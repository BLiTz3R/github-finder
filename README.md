# GitHub Finder v1.0

User inputs a GitHub username, presses button, and various data is fetched and displayed about the given GH account, like his avatar image, how many repos and followers they have, 5 last active repos with links and much more!

v1.0: GitHub Finder was created as a project for a udemy.com course, and edited/perfected by myself.
